metaheuristics todo:
- run a save state + lua script to keep it running
- write something to a text file when running lua script (useful later to take measurements)
- read from a text file (to interepret solutions generated perhaps by python)
- trigger the "run emulator" from the python script and wait for a given "keyword" to stop execution
- create the genetic algorithm initial example implementation
